# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
## Analysis Overview: The Silver Tsunami Response
The purpose of this analysis was to create two tables and their corresponding csv files. The first table contains information on the number of employees retiring and their position/title within the company. The second table shows the employees who are elegible to become bart of a mentorship program. Both of these tables will be used to help mitigate the potential impact of the company's large retirement exodus.

## Results
The first table containing the titles of employees and how many employees are retiring from each one:[retiring_titles.csv](https://github.com/ltmurphy/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis/blob/main/Data/retiring_titles.csv)

The second table containing the employees who are eligible for a mentorship program: [mentorship_eligibility.csv](https://github.com/ltmurphy/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_elegibility.csv)

The tables help provide a clear view of what is happening within the company. Four major point arise:
1.) The Senior Staff and Senior Engineers make up over sixty percent of the retiring employees with a third coming from each position.
2.) These positions will need to be the main focus of any efforts to mentor or other mitigations. 
3.) The mentorship program elegibility table lists 1,549 employees who qualify.
4.) Unfortunately for the company, the number of upcoming retirees vastly outnumbers the number of potential mentors.

## Summary
Many steps can be taken to help soften this blow and facilitate the continued survival of the company. The most important factor involved in any of those steps is time. With such a large deficit between the number of retirees and mentors, the sooner plans can be laid and enacted, the more the negative impact will be minimized. Those willing to be a part of the mentor program should immediately be utilized. I say those willing because not all of the 1,549 elegible will actually commit. Unforseeable factors outside work will prevent many from participating. Therefore, the mentorship program will need bolstering. The company needs to look externally for potential employees who have prior experience and could immediately become a mentor upon hiring. 

Another avenue is to look within. The company can take steps to further clarify the data. Internal surveys can be issued along with a company health program designed to identify which if any employees are not planning on retiring upon immediat qualification. Their retirement will no longer be a factor in this immediate retirement cycle and many can potentially be a part of the mentorship program for an extended time.

One final potential path comes in the form of incentives. An increase in pay and/or benefits may convince more of the elegible mentors to participate. They could even make some employees who are on the fence about retiring right away decide to stay a little longer. These incentives should extend to incoming employees as well. Any of these actions will be one more fortification that helps hold against the "silver tsunami" and time is of the essence.
